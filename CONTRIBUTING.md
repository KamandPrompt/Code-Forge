General Guidelines for Contributing:

- Clean and Readable Code: Remember, someone else will be reading your code. Or you might be reading your code six months down the line and wondering, "What sorcery is this?"
- Comment When Necessary: Not everything in life needs an explanation, but your complex code snippets sure do.
- Avoid Duplication: Before pushing a new algorithm or application, ensure that it doesn't already exist in the repository.
- Stay Relevant: Make sure your contributions stick to the theme – DSA, ML Algorithms, or applications to visualize/implement these algorithms.
- Make sure your organisation is set as "Indian Institute of Technology Mandi" in your profile before making your contributions.

What Can Lead to PR Rejection:

- Plagiarism of any kind.
- Submitting someone else’s work.
- Incomplete or broken code.
- Ignoring the general guidelines mentioned above.
