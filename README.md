An Interactive Repository for Immersive Algorithmic Exploration and Learning.

This repository is currently initialised to the bare minimum. 
Keep Solving Issues and make meaningful Pull Requests.

- The aim of this repository is to make an interactive algorithm learning platform , built for the students and by the students.
- We will be having 3 folders, basic code for Data Structure and Algorithms, basic code for Machine Learning Algortihms and an Applications Folder again subdivided into DSA and ML Algorithms that will contain the application for the corresponding algorithm.
